# Project-2

Project 2 Description (60 pts)

For this project, you will add CSS to the 3-page website you built for project 1.
 
Use your Project One directory in Github to create a Project Two directory. You can branch it or create a new empty repostory and just copy and past your project 1 code. If you want to learn branching, seek help videos online. Create a new Canvas post under "Project Two" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:
The URL to your Project 2 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link
Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page (Use the live link to validate).

Requirements

ALL THE REQUIRMENTS FROM PROJECT 1 STILL APPLY!
One valid, error-free CSS file with your original code.
Remove the list-style from navigation on all three pages with a single CSS declaration.
Apply at least five different style elements to each of your pages.
Centered horizontal-navigation. At the top of and identical on every page.
Use one imported font style and one browser native font style.
Six screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page. Use the live link to validate. (-50% if it doesn't validate)
Your HTML and CSS files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries
You must use relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS to make your pages fluid. You may use px units to put a maximum size or within content areas.
Create at least one fluid layout page using relative units (em, rem, vm, %) and one fixed width layout page.
A subjective grade will be applied to websites that are not creative and just apply the minimum required style.
